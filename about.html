                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am a Vietnamese American UX/UI designer interested in working in the gaming industry. I previously worked as a registered nurse (RN) for a year, and while I loved taking care of others, it didn't quite satisfy my creative self. During my career transition, I ventured to learn more about the tech indsutry and briefly learned about HTML and CSS from Codeacademy for Full Web Development. I then stumbled upon UX/UI design when taking a career test, signed up for a University of Denver's UX/UI Design Bootcamp, and I have fallen in love with it ever since!</p>

            <h2>My UX/UI Skills</h2>
            <div>
                <h4>User Research</h4>
                <p>I figure out the thought processes and pain points of users and stakeholder through research methods like qualitative user interviews.</p>
                <p>Tool: Google Drive</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>User Empathy</h4>
                <p>To display users/stakeholders needs, I create a user persona, empathy map, and/or a user journey map, so others are able to understand their thought processes and pain points. Their needs become my main focus throughout the project.</p>
                <p>Tools: Miro, Figma, Google Drive</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Qualitative Interviews</h4>
                <p>I create an interview plan prior to my interviews. During my interviews, I like to ensure to my participants that no answer is a wrong answer so that the user experience I create is authentic and better for them.</p>
                <p>Tool: Google Drive</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Tools I Know</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Figma</li>
                    <li>Google Drive</li>
                    <li>Miro</li>
                    <li>Trello</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Usability Testing</h4>
                <p>I create a usability test plan prior to conducting testing. During testing, I like to incorporate Steve Krug’s Usability Test Script to understand participant’s first impression of the product.</p>
                <p>Tool: Google Drive</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Information Architecture</h4>
                <p>When working on the IA of a product, I like to focus on who our user is and tailor the IA to the target audience. Card sorting and site mapping are the 2 techniques/skills I utilize for IA.</p>
                <p>Tools: Miro, Figma</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Wireframing/Prototyping</h4>
                <p>I like to develop products from a bottom to top approach, so I would start with wireframing or the layout of the product and then build upon that to create the desired prototype.</p>
                <p>Tool: Figma</p>
            </div>

            <h2>What I Do When I'm Not Working</h2>
            <p>If you can't find me at my computer, I am either drawing/painting, playing cozy games, or watching a Korean drama or anime. I am currently watching One Piece and am in the Water 7 arch (If you know, you know).</p>
